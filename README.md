# IMDB EDA

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
In this project, I use python to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an IMDB Movies dataset. Then I use this analysis to create a PowerPoint slide deck.


### Methods Used
* Machine Learning


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Matplotlib


## Project Description
In this scenario, I am a data scientist for a top movie studio. After a series of box office flops, the producers at my studio are starting to question their strategy and need some direction. The producers are asking that I spend some time analyzing the data and present a report detailing my findings along with recommendations on how to revamp the studio's strategy. In this project, I challenged myself to perform EDA to find useful information in only 4 hours. I wanted to demonstrate my ability to quickly and efficiently find patterns and trends in the data.
